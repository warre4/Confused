# Confused

WORK IN PROGRESS!

I started making Confused Engine in C++ using Vulkan and C++ modules (.ixx files). Due to modules intellisence being quite buggy and modules still not being properly supported in some areas (like CMake), I've put this project on hold while I work on another [engine](https://github.com/warre4/Fire "Fire Engine"). 

I was following the Vulkan tutorial from their website and stopped somewhere in there so all of the other things that are implemented should be relatively complete and stable.
