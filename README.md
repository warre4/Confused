# Confused

WORK IN PROGRESS!

I started making Confused Engine in C++ using Vulkan and C++ modules (.ixx files). Due to modules intellisence being quite buggy, modules still not being properly supported by any compilers or things like cmake, and the time this project would require, I might revert to .cpp and .h files (which are a requirement for some parts anyway). 

I was following the Vulkan tutorial from their website and stopped somewhere in there so all of the other things that are implemented should be relatively complete code unless there are comments saying otherwise.
