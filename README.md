# Confused

WORK IN PROGRESS!

Confused Engine I started making in C++ using Vulkan and C++ modules (.ixx files). Due to modules intellisence being quite buggy, modules still not being properly supported by any compilers or things like cmake, and the time this project would require, I have abandoned it for now. I was following the Vulkan tutorial from their website and stopped somewhere in there so all of the other things that are implemented should be relatively complete code if there are no comments.
My previous 2D engine called [Budgety](https://gitlab.com/warre.engels/budgety "Budgety") that I made as a school project has some valuable code but one of the compiler updates made it unable to compile and the errors are all very obscure, I tried going back in compiler versions and fixing as many errors as I could but I don't think I can fix the compilation errors in less than a few weeks or even at all (trust me I already lost a lot of time on it).
