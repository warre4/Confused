# Confused

WORK IN PROGRESS!

Confused Engine is a 2D engine made in C++ using Vulkan.
I have started making a [2D engine](https://gitlab.com/warre.engels/budgety "Budgety") before but I am starting over and making a new one.
This engine will (hopefully) work with an event based system and will use modules (.ixx files) as much as possilbe. At least that is the plan for now, maybe it will go back to .cpp and .h files in the future.
